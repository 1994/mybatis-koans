This directory is pull of little ant scriptlets that can be used to run maven profiles in Eclipse.

These scriptlets were auto generated with the buildMavenScriptlets.groovy script in the helper directory. If you add more koans, you can modify that script and rerun it.  Run it from inside the helper directory.  It takes no command line args.

Before running the scriptlets, modify the `mvn.properties` files with the path to the mvn or mvn.bat script from your maven installation.
